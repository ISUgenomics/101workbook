UAS between the weights of 0.55 and 55lb must be registered either as Part 107 or with an waiver (COA). UAS flights must be below 400ft and within sightline of the operator. When running a UAS, have a certified operator along with a visual observer. Have at least 2 people on site.

There is more than the cost of the aircraft
